## Welcome
Welcome to the OWASP Bergen chapter. We strive to be an open and including community for everyone. Please refer to [Code of conduct](https://owasp.org/www-policy/operational/code-of-conduct/){:target='_blank'}.

We are a newly approved chapter and this page is still under construction. This page will be updated shortly with a meetup group, and check back later for events.

If you have any questions or comments, please contact one of the leaders by mail.

## Participation
The Open Worldwide Application Security Project (OWASP) is a nonprofit foundation that works to improve the security of software. All of our projects ,tools, documents, forums, and chapters are free and open to anyone interested in improving application security. 

Chapters are led by local leaders in accordance with the [Chapters Policy](/www-policy/operational/chapters). Financial contributions should only be made online using the authorized online donation button. 

Everyone is welcome and encouraged to participate in our [Projects](/projects/), [Local Chapters](/chapters/), [Events](/events/), [Online Groups](https://groups.google.com/a/owasp.com/){:target='_blank'}, and [Community Slack Channel](https://owasp.slack.com/){:target='_blank'}. We especially encourage diversity in all our initiatives. OWASP is a fantastic place to learn about application security, to network, and even to build your reputation as an expert. We also encourage you to be [become a member](/membership/) or consider a [donation](/donate/) to support our ongoing work.
